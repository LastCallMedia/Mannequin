## What is this?

Mannequin is a themer's tool.  It's intended to allow rapid, focused development on individual templates (components) in isolation from all the other craziness that comes along with developing a dynamic website.

Specifically, Mannequin thinks in terms of individual components.  Components are chunks of markup that can stand on their own.  They may be composed of other components, but they can be thought of as self-sufficient objects.  Styling from one component should be self-contained and not dependent on the styling of unrelated components.

As a tool, Mannequin's goal is to help you focus on markup and styling for one component at a time.  We hope you like it!


## Our Influences

We would be remiss if we didn't mention the excellent [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) as our primary influence.  As an introduction to atomic theming, Pattern Lab is great, but we found that it fell a little short when it came to integrating with the templates we were _actually_ using in our applications.  As a result, we created this tool for internal use, and decided to open source it.
